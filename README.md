# Gilded Rose

This is the Gilded Rose kata in Rescript with Jest. I copied the initial code from https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/main/rescript.

This is my take on the refactoring.
Focus here is to have "atomic" commits and leverage Rescript's type system to make the code more reliable with successive small refactors.

## Getting started

```sh
yarn install
```

## Running tests

To run all tests

```sh
yarn test
```

To run all tests in watch mode

```sh

```

```
